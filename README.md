# Google Play Store Data Analysis

This Scala project analyzes data from the Google Play Store dataset using Apache Spark. It performs various operations on the dataset, such as filtering, sorting, and calculating aggregate statistics.

## Prerequisites

- Apache Spark: Ensure Apache Spark is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
- Scala: Scala should be installed on your machine. You can download Scala from the official website: [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- Java: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so Java is required.
- Maven: Maven is used for dependency management and building the project. Make sure Maven is installed on your machine. You can download Maven from the official website: [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Running the Project

1. Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

2. Run the main analysis script:

```bash
spark-submit --class xpandit.ProcessFiles target/xpandit-spark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

3. The output files will be generated in the `output` directory.


## Project Structure

- `src/main/scala`: Contains the main Scala source code files.
- `src/test/scala`: Contains the test files.
- `datasets`: Contains the input CSV files for analysis.
